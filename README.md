## Project Management

Throughout this assignment, project management techniques were applied. A Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) was created to map the project requirements and ensure their fulfillment. Additionally, user stories were created to define specific features and functionalities. You can find the attached files for the RTM and user stories in the repository [rtm and user stories](rtm_UserStories.xlsx).

## Data Source

The data used in the `data` folder is completely open source and obtained from [Data.world](https://data.world/jfreex/products-catalog-from-newchiccom). It provides a catalog of products from Newchic.com. Please note that the data is used for demonstration and testing purposes only.
